# Edveni Innovations LLP — Single Page Website

This is a minimal one-page website for Edveni Innovations LLP. It was created as a simple, responsive landing page with sections for About, Services and Contact. The design has been updated with a hero graphic, logo, and icons.

Files added/updated:
- `index.html` — single page content (updated UI)
- `css/styles.css` — site styles (improved visuals)
- `js/script.js` — small JS for the footer year, smooth scrolling, and contact form handling
- `images/` — simple SVG assets (logo, hero graphic, service icons)

How to open locally:
1. Open the folder `d:\0-Edveni\Website` in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser, or right-click and choose a browser.

Notes & next steps:
- The contact form uses `mailto:` which opens the user's email client; to make a server-backed form we can add a server endpoint or use a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- If you'd like higher-resolution photography or branded imagery, provide assets and I will integrate them (hero photo, logo PNG/SVG, sample projects).
- I can also deploy this to GitHub Pages or Netlify and configure a custom domain.

Contact address used in the page: `evdeni30@gmail.com`. If you prefer a different email or phone, tell me and I'll update the page.
